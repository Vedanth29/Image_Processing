Image Arithmetic-

formula A (x,y) o B(x,y) = I(x,y)

The important requirement in image arithmetic is that all (input and output) the images are of the same size MxM.

Arithmetic operations are done pixelwise. Let p = A(x,y) and q = B(x,y) be the pixel values to be operated on and r =I(x,y) be the result of the operation.
